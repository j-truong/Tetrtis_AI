# Tetris AI
Developed an AI to learn to play the game Tetris utlising the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Trialled many heuristics and input data, but have not achieved a perfect input heuristic for the AI to learn to play the game effectively. 

This project is still under progress.
